The goal of CodaLab Worksheets is to faciliate transparent, reproducible, and
collaborative research in computation- and data-intensive areas such as machine
learning.

The CodaLab Bundle Service allows users to create *bundles*, which are
immutable directories containing code or data.  Bundles are either
uploaded or created from other bundles by executing arbitrary commands.
When the latter happens, all the provenance information is preserved.  In
addition, users can create *worksheets*, which interleave bundles with
free-form textual descriptions, allowing one to easily describe an experimental
workflow.

The CodaLab frontend holds the React front-end web interface for CodaLab worksheets.
