class WorkerManager(object):
    """
    The abstract class for a worker manager.  Different backends like AWS,
    Azure, Slurm should override `get_worker_jobs` and `start_worker_job`.

    The basic architecture of the WorkerManager is extremely simple: to a
    first-order approximation, it simply launches `cl-worker`s as AWS/Azure
    batch jobs as long as there are staged bundles.

    The simplicity means that we don't need to manage state about how workers
    and bundles are related - that logic is complex and is done by the usual
    worker system, and we don't want to duplicate that for every possible
    worker backend.

    More specifically, a worker manager will monitor a job queue to see how
    many worker jobs are running, and try to keep that between `min_workers`
    and `max_workers`.  It will also monitor the staged bundles that satisfy a
    certain `search` criterion.  If there are staged bundles then it will issue
    a `start_worker_job()` call, provided some other conditions are met (e.g.,
    don't start workers too fast).

    The WorkerManager is all client-side code, so it can be customized as one
    sees fit.

    Notes:
    - The worker manager is not visible via CodaLab (i.e., CodaLab has no
      notion of a worker manager or what it's trying to do - all it sees is
      bundles and workers).  One needs to monitor the AWS/Azure Batch system
      separately.
    - Resource handling is not currently supported.  Generally, the safe thing
      is to create a separate queue for different resource needs and put the
      burden of deciding on the user.
