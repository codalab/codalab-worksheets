# Multiple Bundle Stores (in development)

!!! warning "Unreleased feature"
        This feature is still in development. It does not fully work yet and will only work once [#3710](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-worksheets/issues/3710) is resolved.

CodaLab allows you to specify multiple bundle stores.

## Workflow steps

This workflow describes how to set up a bundle store on GCP.

To create a bundle store, run the following:

```bash
cl store add --name store1 --storage-type disk --storage-format uncompressed
```

You can list bundle stores by running

```bash
cl store ls
```

You can also delete a bundle store by running

```bash
cl store rm [bundle store uuid]
```

## Steps to test locally with Azurite

First, make sure you start Azurite locally by running `codalab-service start -bds default azurite`. Then run:

```
cl store add --name blob --storage-type azure_blob --url azfs://devstoreaccount1/bundles
cl upload --store blob mkdocs.yml
cl run --store blob "echo hello"
```

## Steps to set up and test with GCP

First, make sure the `CODALAB_GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` env var is set on the server that runs the REST server. It should be set to a path to a credentials JSON file (see this page for more information on how to create it: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#iam-service-account-keys-create-console).

```
export CODALAB_GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/credentials.json
codalab-service start -bd
```

Then make a bucket on your GCP account (in this case, it's called `ashwin123123123`). You can then store bundles on GCP:

```
cl store add --name gcp2 --storage-type gcs --url gs://ashwin123123123
cl upload --store gcp2 mkdocs.yml
cl run --store gcp2 "echo hello"
```

## Setting a default bundle store

Once a bundle store is created, you can restart the server and set the `CODALAB_DEFAULT_BUNDLE_STORE_NAME` environment variable. This will make bundles be uploaded, by default, to the specified bundle store.

```
CODALAB_DEFAULT_BUNDLE_STORE_NAME=blob codalab-service start ...
```

## Infer store type from url
To add a new Azure/GCS bundle store, we can have simplified ways to specify. To simplify the `cl store add` command, you can only specify the URL without specifying `--store_type` in the command.
For example, you can add a new bundle store on GCP using the following command:
```bash
cl store add --name gcp2 --url gs://ashwin123123123
```
The `--store_type` parameter is inferred from the URL.

You can also use the following simplified command to add a new bundle store on Azure.
```bash
cl store add --name blob --url azfs://devstoreaccount1/bundles
```

## Todo (unreleased features)

- cl replicate
- Later: by default it should always use Blob / GCS instead of disk if someone just runs `cl upload mkdocs.yml`.
