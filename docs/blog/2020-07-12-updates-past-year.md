# Updates from the past year

July 12, 2020

Dear CodaLab Worksheets users,

We hope this email finds you safe during these difficult times. We recognize that the COVID pandemic and recent events of racial violence have shone a spotlight on inequities in society -- and we strongly support efforts to inform others about and work towards mitigating these inequities.

We'll now be posting major announcements and changes to CodaLab on this blog. We'll also be sending out an occasional email digest to all CodaLab Worksheets users with the updates posted on this blog. If you're interested in being added to the email list, please email <a href="mailto:codalab.worksheets@gmail.com">codalab.worksheets@gmail.com</a>.

Here are some of the major new features that have recently been released:

## New frontend

We've introduced a new frontend that allows you to edit cells directly from the UI without having to go and edit source. The worksheet header is now sticky, so the main buttons to add text / upload / run are easily accessible from the top.

## New bundle view

We have a new and more compact bundle view on the worksheets screen that makes it easier to find the information you need about a particular bundle.

## Async loading

Worksheet loading is now faster, after the addition of async loading of search results and file contents.

## Search bar for worksheets

We've added a search bar for worksheets, allowing you to more easily access the worksheets you need.

## Cut, copy, and paste

The addition of a cut / copy / paste feature has made it easier to manage worksheets exclusively by interacting through the frontend GUI.

## Upload directories

Users can now upload directories and multiple files from the browser ([#2043](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-worksheets/pull/2043)).

## Looking for contributors

We couldn't have done this without all the feedback from users and help from contributors! [Open an issue](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-worksheets/issues/new/choose) if there is something else you would like to see in CodaLab Worksheets.

We are also looking for contributors to help maintain CodaLab and work on new features. If you are interested in working with the team, please contact <a href="mailto:codalab.worksheets@gmail.com">codalab.worksheets@gmail.com</a>.

Thanks
